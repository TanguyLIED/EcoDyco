# EcoDyco

A macroeconomic software for a Ô¨Ånite world: a short presentation 


**EcoDyco** is an overlay for macro-economic models that aim to take into account the constraints related to resources, particularly in terms of their quantity and quality. The *EcoDyco Manual V1.pdf* explains the different parameters and a paper (in preparation) explains how to build the model.

The general parameters are in the header of *main.py*. To create new airframes and economical engines see the *EcoDyco Manual V1.pdf*.


### Run the world
A minimum configuration includes the files *main.py*, *PhysicalWorld.py*, at least one economic engine (e.g. *Goodwin.py*, *ZeroGrowth.py*, *Solow.py*) and the corresponding parameter files in *preproc/*

Then, from a terminal, execute :
```
python3 main.py
```
or in an ipython console (via spyder or other)
```
run main.py
```
